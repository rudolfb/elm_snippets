Elm snippets for Sublime Text 2 and 3

Type the snippet shortcode and then press Tab to complete the snippet.

The snippets are listed below in alphabetical order. The '$1' indicates the position of the caret/s. Some snippets have been set up so that pressing Tab jumps the caret/s to the next predefined spot. Any snippet that has a $1/$2/$3/etc. uses this technique.
